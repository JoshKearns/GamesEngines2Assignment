For this project I want to showcase the flocking algorithm through an underwater scene.

I think this makes far better use of the AI techniques required from this project and will be visually more interesting.

I will be using a low poly asset pack for most of the environment and fish models.

The low poly design will help keep the scene running smoothly.
