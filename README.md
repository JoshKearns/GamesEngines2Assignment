For this project I want to showcase the flocking algorithm through an underwater scene.

I think this makes far better use of the AI techniques required from this project and will be visually more interesting.


Scene 1:
Camera over the surface of the water, slowly submergis. Show close up of kril.

Scene 2:
Whale swallows kril, camera turns and follows.

Scene 3:
At a certain depth the camera focuses on fish following the whale and pans down to reef.

Scene 4:
Camera orbits reef showing a variety of fish interacting with reef and each other.

Scene 5: 
Shark swoops in, fish avoid shark.
